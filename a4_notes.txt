-Do not minus camera center from ray direction. The ray direction is already wrt camera origin.
-For depth image, it is maxDepth - hit.time. If you use hit.time - minDepth, bright would correspond to far.
-For normal image, abs all x, y, z components to display correctly.
-Be careful how you specify the screen point. what is i and what is j?
-Background color is NOT a part of Phong shading.
-Remember to multiply the normal vector when calculating reflected ray: r = v - 2*dot(v.n)*n  <--
-You need to normalize all normals, even those computed by Barycentric interpolation. some specularity was wrong for bunny_1k
-DO NOT normalize the transformed ray direction in Transform.
